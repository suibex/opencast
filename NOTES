How will opencast work?


you have a device (opencast caster).
it connects to our webserver and just says that it connected.
after that, our server remembers the IP address and says that it is caster.

then when you have our extension , it will just check your ip for casters. if there are some . it will show them.
for yt it is easy.
you have caster.
which actually just receives data through SSL sockets.
if a request for popup arrives it opens a link through xdg-open on Linux.
if a copy/paste request popup arrives , it reads that stuff and writes the data into clipboard.



Our Client is basically a Linux executable (so that it could be built on android and PC) - for copying data.
For android casting , we will add a seperate option somewhere xd.

URL broadcasting works as a basic "test.py"
Clipboard sharing next one.
